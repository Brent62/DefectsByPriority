## Overview

This is a Rally App SDK app that shows a grid of defects, filtered by the priority selected in a combobox.

To build the app, clone this repository and run rake (you must have Ruby installed).  The default rake task will create App.html, which you can copy and paste directly into a Rally custom panel.  You can find more information on installing Ruby and using rake tasks to simplify app development here: https://rally1.rallydev.com/apps/2.0p/doc/#!/guide/appsdk_20_starter_kit

You can also find an already-built version of the app in the Downloads section of this repository.  You'll need to right click on DefectsByPriority.html and use Save Link As ... to save it to your local file system, since simply clicking the link will cause most browsers to attempt to load the HTML directly.
