This is a Rally App SDK app that shows a grid of defects, filtered by the priority selected in a combobox.

To build the app, clone this repository and run rake (you must have Ruby installed).  The default rake task will create App.html, which you can copy and paste directly into a Rally custom panel.

You can also find an already-built version of the app in the Downloads section of this repository.
